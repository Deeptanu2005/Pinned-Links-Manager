## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing **Deeptanu Sen** at [deeptanusends2005@icloud.com](mailto:deeptanusends2005@icloud.com).

Please include as much information as possible to help us understand and resolve the issue promptly. We will respond to security reports within 48 hours and will provide a detailed plan to address the issue.

## Future Security Enhancements

In future updates, we plan to add the following security features:
- User account management system.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Security Best Practices

Until these features are implemented, we recommend the following best practices for using the Pinned Links Manager:

- Regularly update your local copy of the project to the latest version.
- Avoid sharing sensitive information through the links added to the manager.
- Regularly review and audit your code for security vulnerabilities.
- Follow best practices for secure coding and OWASP guidelines.

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure!
